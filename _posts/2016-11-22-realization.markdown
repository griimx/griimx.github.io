Today is the day, to be exact it is late night or rather early morning when i have realized that i have let my life slip through and have no longer the control that one must have. I have become quite addicted to Gambling and am fully aware that it's taking all the most important part of my life. I am currently a Third Year Student pursuing Computer Engineering, and have forgotten my love for coding and hacking stuff. I have lost interest from every activity i once used to do. Gambling has in turn made me look like a freak. I skip classes and don't perform the activities or study the subjects that are meant to be studied in the following semester. I don't think it's quite late to realize. I am at around C Grade after the  Mid Semesters in this semester that is 5th Semester. And am thinking of a plan to at least maintain a A- Grade overall.

I haven't lost a lot in Gambling rather have made profit, but the never realized the cost of it. Time, it is the important thing that i was spending to earn profit. The several number of hours i have wasted on gambling will surely have an effect on my life, but i guess i am not too late. I have exactly 1 Week, that is 7days =  7 x 24 hours = 168 hours. out of which if i count 8 hours of sleep daily, 112 hours left. I need to utilize it to the fullest to cover number of items that i have stacked up this semester. Listing all of them : 

1. Computer Architecture (Theory)
2. Computer Architecture (Lab)
3. Operating Systems (Theory)
4. Networks (Theory)
5. Networks (Lab)
6. Software Engineering (Presentation)
7. Big Data and Software Engineering (Theory)
8. Software Project TOP PRIORITY!!

I play a lot of PC Games, basically one game that is Counter Strike Global Offensive and waste around 40-90 hours every 2 weeks on it, which in turn is a lot. As i am writing this entry, i am uninstalling it along with it, along with it i am completely erasing my Steam Account. 

My top priorities from today onward will be :

1. Further investigation on Higher Education i want to pursue
2. Start Solving Problems to crack technical interviews.
3. Read Data Structures, SQL and Operating Systems On the Go.
4. I want to follow all the weekly mangas, they will act as the only source of refreshment.
5. Stop spending money on worthless items and fast food, eat fruits.
6. Maybe go for a walk and think. 
7. Start Reading to New Words and memorizing them to increase my Vocabulary.
8. Start Reading about stock markets LEAST PRIORITY!!

With this i want to end my first entry, setting the start point to bring back my life to what it was supposed to be like.
