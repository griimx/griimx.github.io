This Entry will keep a track of all the tasks i go through in order to complete the software project that i have delayed and stacked up for the last day.

Describing the software project a little bit, namely Multi User Text Editor that is a python tkinter based Text Editor that allows multiple users to collaborate together on a same document in real time. I at present don't have a single clue how to proceed further, but have completed the code for a simple editor and all the GUI Frames that will be used to achieve the goal of this project.

State of project when i started this entry : I have code for a simple editor, and all the GUIs that will be used to create this software project.

#**Update 1**
I researched my way all through Stackoverflow and Quora and reached some solutions. Looks like i am going to skip all the classes tomorrow. Next week every working day i have a lab evaluation and my software project group mates are starting to get worried as the deadline is getting close, they are afraid of the documents. So i had to ensure them of some progress but literally i have still no idea. 

The things i came to know about Multi User Text Editor are :
**Operational Transformation** The Algorithm that will manage the commits made my different users at a time and how to handle them without causing any conflicts.
