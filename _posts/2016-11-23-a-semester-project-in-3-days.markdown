This Entry will keep a track of all the tasks i go through in order to complete the software project that i have delayed and stacked up for the last day.

Describing the software project a little bit, namely Multi User Text Editor that is a python tkinter based Text Editor that allows multiple users to collaborate together on a same document in real time. I at present don't have a single clue how to proceed further, but have completed the code for a simple editor and all the GUI Frames that will be used to achieve the goal of this project.

State of project when i started this entry : I have code for a simple editor, and all the GUIs that will be used to create this software project.

#**Update 1**
I researched my way all through Stackoverflow and Quora and reached some solutions. Looks like i am going to skip all the classes tomorrow. Next week every working day i have a lab evaluation and my software project group mates are starting to get worried as the deadline is getting close, they are afraid of the documents. So i had to ensure them of some progress but literally i have still no idea. 

The things i came to know about Multi User Text Editor are :
**Operational Transformation** The Algorithm that will manage the commits made my different users at a time and how to handle them without causing any conflicts.

#**Update 2**
I am done with Syntax Highlighting, used Pygment package for creating tags and parsing them to highlight keywords. For upcoming evaluation i am leaving it with default Python syntax detection. But will certainly add more code to guess the program language by file name.
Starting of with writing code for client and server side. Py-infinote came to rescue. Demo codes in Jinfinote, a Javascript implementation of the Infinote protocol, protocol designed to manage requests by a server in text collaborative scenario.
