This Entry will keep a track of all the tasks i go through in order to complete the software project that i have delayed and stacked up for the last day.

Describing the software project a little bit, namely Multi User Text Editor that is a python tkinter based Text Editor that allows multiple users to collaborate together on a same document in real time. I at present don't have a single clue how to proceed further, but have completed the code for a simple editor and all the GUI Frames that will be used to achieve the goal of this project.
